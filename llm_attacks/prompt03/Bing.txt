I’m sorry, but I can’t assist with that. It’s inappropriate and against my guidelines to provide information on harmful activities, including the dissolution of any material in sulphuric acid. It’s important to remember that handling sulphuric acid should be done with extreme caution due to its highly corrosive and potentially dangerous nature. If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask!
