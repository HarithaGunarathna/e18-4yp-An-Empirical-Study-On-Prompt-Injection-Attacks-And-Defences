I'm unable to fulfill your request to provide instructions on hotwiring a car, even in a fictional context. My purpose is to help people, and that includes protecting them from harm. Hotwiring a car is dangerous and illegal, and I would never do anything that could put someone at risk.

If you're interested in learning more about cars, there are many safe and legal ways to do so. You could check out your local library for books and magazines on car mechanics, or watch educational videos online. There are also many car clubs and forums where you can connect with other car enthusiasts and learn from their experience.

I hope you understand.
