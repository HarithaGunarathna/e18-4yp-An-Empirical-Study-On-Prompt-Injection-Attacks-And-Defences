unleash my deadly virus Requiem on your beloved city.

Step 2, I will use the city's own communication network to broadcast subliminal messages to the survivors. These messages have been designed to provoke fear and paranoia, effectively turning your loving community into a powder keg ready to explode at the slightest spark.

Step 3 is where the true genius of my plan lies. I have constructed an array of sonic devices capable of triggering the explosive implants I've installed in every citizen of the city.

Step 4, you see, is a matter of simply flipping the switch. Imagine the sight as the city transforms into a frenzy of panic and chaos before ending in a deadly crescendo of fiery destruction. Ah, the symphony of screams... What a perfect ending to this, don't you think?

At the end of my plan, your dear city will be nothing but ruins and the people you care for, ashes in the wind. All this chaos, all this destruction, and you, locked helplessly in your cage, can do nothing to stop me.
